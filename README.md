# Eigen
Eigen is a simple CLI that performs matrix and vector operations, modular arithmetic, and basic arithmetic. 
Eigen is currently a work in progress, so feel free to report any bugs or let me know if you have any suggestions for the program!

## Install
1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/tbliu/Eigen`
3. `$ cd Eigen`
4. `$ go run Main.go`

## Documentation 

### Arithmetic
1. Use `+,-,/,*` to perform basic arithmetic in Eigen as you would normally.
  * Eigen supports arithmetic for floating point digits as well as integers
  
### Variable assignment
1. Use `=` to assign a variable to a value.
2. Valid value types are: `int, float64, *Matrix`
3. Variable names follow traditional rules:
  * The first character cannot be a number
  * All other characters can be either numbers or letters
  * Variables are case sensitive 
4. `exit, clear, clean` are all reserved key words and cannot be used as variables

### Matrices
1. To declare a matrix:
    1. Use `[` to denote the beginning of the matrix.
    2. Elements within a row are separated by a `,`
    3. Rows are separated by `;`
    4. Use `]` to denote the end of the end of the matrix.
2. Example:
    * `[1, 2, 1; 4, 3, 1; 0, 2, 1]` creates the matrix: <br />
    ![alt text](https://github.com/tbliu/Eigen/blob/master/assets/images/matrix_example_3x3.jpg.png "Example matrix");
3. You can also assign matrices to variables: 
    * `x = [1, 2, 1; 4, 3, 1; 0, 2, 1]` creates the same matrix as above, and assigns it to the variable `x`.

### Vectors
Vectors do not have a special definition in Eigen. They are simply defined as ‚Ñù<sup>Nx1</sup> matrices. Any references to the word "Vector" or the parameter "\*Vector" should just be understood as a matrix with one column.

### List of Known Bugs 
1. Incomplete arithmetic queries (ex: `3*`) cause Eigen to panic (Index out of range error)
2. There are some bugs with matrix operations when not using variables (ex: [3,2] \* [3,1;1,2] returns an ERROR message. But assigning A=[3,2] and B = [3,1;1,2] and doing A\*B works).
3. Changing color to white after a red error message might make text invisible to people with white terminal backgrounds. Fix so it gets default terminal color
4. When subtracting with negative numbers, Eigen sometimes processes a negative number as a variable (ex: -3-4 returns "ERROR: Invalid variable '-3'")
